Finally, we divide by the total number of images to get the accuracy. \n\nNote that we don't need to apply softmax to the outputs, since it doesn't change the relative order of the results. This is because `e^x` is an increasing function i.e. if `y1 > y2`, then `e^y1 > e^y2` and the same holds true after averaging out the values to get the softmax.\n\nLet's calculate the accuracy of the current model, on the first batch of data.

It's not a differentiable function. `torch.max` and `==` are both non-continuous and non-differentiable operations, so we can't use the accuracy for computing gradients w.r.t the weights and biases.\n\n2. It doesn't take into account the actual probabilities predicted by the model, so it can't provide sufficient feedback for incremental improvements. \n\nDue to these reasons, accuracy is a great **evaluation metric** for classification, but not a good loss function. A commonly used loss function for classification problems is the **cross entropy**, which has the following formula:\n\n![cross-entropy](https://i.imgur.com/VDRDl1D.png)\n\nWhile it looks complicated, it's actually quite simple:\n\n* For each output row, pick the predicted probability for the correct label. E.g. if the predicted probabilities for an image are `[0.1, 0.3, 0.2, ...]` and the correct label is `1`, we pick the corresponding element `0.3` and ignore the rest.\n\n* Then, take the [logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm) of the picked probability. If the probability is high i.e. close to 1, then its logarithm is a very small negative value, close to 0. And if the probability is low (close to 0), then the logarithm is a very large negative value. We also multiply the result by -1, which results is a large postive value of the loss for poor predictions.\n\n* Finally, take the average of the cross entropy across all the output rows to get the overall loss for a batch of data.\n\nUnlike accuracy, cross-entropy is a continuous and differentiable function that also provides good feedback for incremental improvements in the model (a slightly higher probability for the correct label leads to a lower loss). This makes it a good choice for the loss function. \n\nAs you might expect, PyTorch provides an efficient and tensor-friendly implementation of cross entropy as part of the `torch.nn.functional` package.

You can try reducing the learning rate and training for a few more epochs to see if it helps.\n\nThe more likely reason that **the model just isn't powerful enough**. If you remember our initial hypothesis, we have assumed that the output (in this case the class probabilities) is a **linear function** of the input (pixel intensities), obtained by perfoming a matrix multiplication with the weights matrix and adding the bias. This is a fairly weak assumption, as there may not actually exist a linear relationship between the pixel intensities in an image and the digit it represents. While it works reasonably well for a simple dataset like MNIST (getting us to 85% accuracy), we need more sophisticated models that can capture non-linear relationships between image pixels and labels for complex tasks like recognizing everyday objects, animals etc. \n\nThis would be a good time to save our work.

Here are a few ideas:\n\n* Try making the validation set smaller or larger, and see how it affects the model.\n* Try changing the learning rate and see if you can achieve the same accuracy in fewer epochs.\n* Try changing the batch size. What happens if you use too high a batch size, or too low?\n* Modify the `fit` function to also track the overall loss and accuracy on the training set, and see how it compares with the validation loss/accuracy. Can you explain why it's lower/higher?\n* Train with a small subset of the data, and see if you can reach a similar level of accuracy.\n* Try building a model for a different dataset, such as the [CIFAR10 or CIFAR100 datasets](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).\n\nHere are some references for further reading:\n* For a more mathematical treatment, see the popular [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/machine-learning/classification-wlPeP) course on Coursera.
